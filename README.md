# Sequential-Bifurcation-in-Optics
Application of Sequential Bifurcation Approach to Hamiltonian and Dissipative cases of Non-Linear Schr√∂dinger's equation (NLS). This solver computes bifurcations 
(solution states dervived by perturbing the system) for 1-D NLS with focusing/defocusing non-linearity.
Plt.jl file is a data pre-processing and plotting screen, which currently needs major refactoring.

Code is written in Julia, and utilised BLAS and DifferentilEquations libraries to ensure fast numerical computation.
